    "This project aims to develop a recommendation system that provides personalized movie recommendations based on user ratings. Utilizing the [MovieLens dataset](https://web.archive.org/web/20240828133414/https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/) from the GroupLens research lab at the University of Minnesota, the model will be trained on a subset of the dataset containing 100,000 user ratings. The primary objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately recommend the top 5 movies to a user, based on their ratings of other movies. This system can be valuable for streaming platforms and movie enthusiasts, offering tailored movie suggestions to enhance user experience and engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will involve several steps, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this project, we will also explore the relationships between different variables and their impact on movie recommendations. This will help us gain insights into user preferences and identify potential areas for improvement. Overall, this project has the potential to provide valuable insights and practical applications for the entertainment industry. By developing a recommendation system that can accurately suggest movies, streaming platforms can better engage their users, improve customer satisfaction, and increase viewership."
